### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:

Not really sure if I'm in the MacReadmeBranch or not, but definitely making changes on the mac using vi on the cloned version after the MacReadmeBranch was created.

Corrected typo from the github GUI after committing the mac brach from the command line.
I did a git fetch origin MacReadmeBranch after a minor change, but the changes
didn't appear. it looks like the fetch didn't do the fast forward merge.
After doing a git pull origin MacReadmeBranch, it looks like it worked.
(I am sort of using GitX to show me the tree structure, and even after the pull,
it looks like the branch isn't showing that it pointing to the latest change
even though the change is in the file I'm editting right now. going to do a local
git commit -a to see what happens.
